Open Private Communications for Humanity

## Loss of Privacy
The world is changing technologically at an ever increasing pace. Privacy, the bedrock of freedom, is being lost at an alarming rate and few know how to maintain it today. How can we enjoy communicating over long distances yet maintain our privacy?
* Most organizations (e.g. ISPs, large tech, banks, governments) track, persist, and use our behavior for their gain.
* Centralized organizations are major targets for theft.
* Closed source software can easily contain hidden back doors for thieves to access our information without our knowledge and many open source applications have closed source libraries embedded in them.
* Smart phones, our primary means of global communication and collaboration, are weak in maintaining our anonymity and privacy - critical to ensuring individual freedom.
* Many messaging applications exist but none have the means to ensure our privacy is maintained.

## Mission
What's our core beliefs that drive us?
* All relationships should be voluntary
* Privacy is the bedrock of freedom - we should be able to communicate as we please privately - anonymity as a base
* Transparency in code/governance 
* We own our data and should be the ones that profit from it

## Objectives
What do we try to achieve?
* Supports sharing of information without being censored and without fear of being persecuted.
* Support peer-to-peer (P2P) communication without the need to depend on servers.
* When information about a user is desired from a 3rd party (e.g. marketer, government consensus),that information can be sold to the 3rd party by the owner yet with/without personally identifiable information (PII) being transferred by choice.
* Provides an identification system so that reputation can be established where necessary.
* Provide a platform that monetizes itself internally.
* Internet not required - The People’s Meshnet - cut the cord to ISPs for good.

## Solution
Provide a messaging application that is fully open-source that requires anyone modifying it to also keep the modifications open source, both software and hardware, and without depending on servers sharing only what the owner specifically allows.

Ensure the platform can monetize itself by monetizing mobile resources - network bandwidth, cpu cycles, and persistent storage - through the use of a utility token to represent them.

The internet was not designed for anonymity. Anonymity must be baked into the system from the beginning at the lowest of levels. Without the ability to provide anonymity, it can not be provided under any circumstance.

### Revenue
The dapp monetizes people's phone resources (network, cpu, storage) on a voluntary basis. 
Tokens are used in this network to keep track of usage. 
Users can also purchase tokens from Users with excess tokens. 
Each User sets their price. 
All token exchanges incur a 0.5% transaction fee to fund development and maintenance of the system. 
It’s desired to reduce this fee to the lowest possible in the future.

### Fund Raising
Crowdsale purchasers may buy tokens at a discount to help fund system development if/when crowdsales have been approved by the organization.
